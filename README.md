# ACM-Godot-SIG
A set of examples used for the ACM GameDev SIG made in Godot<br>

## What is ACM?
The Association for Computing Machinery is an international learned society for computing founded on September 15, 1947, and headquartered in New York City. The ACM is a non-profit professional membership group, reporting nearly 110,000 student and professional members as of 2024.<br>

## Who are we?
My name is Vasileios and I joined the section of ACM located in the Univercity of Patras in 2025.<br>
In the year 2025-2026 I ran a Special Interest Group program focused on Game Development and Game Design. In this currently ongoing program we are going to talk in depth about the details of Game development.<br>
In this SIG we aim to do something more than a YouTube tutorial. While we are going to learn how to make games in the context of Godot, our engine of choice, our focus is to learn the basics of Object Oriented Programming in an attempt to teach those who followed the program how to make Modular components so that they can more easily make big and expandable games that are not a pain to maintain and update.<br>

## What is this Repository?
In this repository you will find a collection the projects we made in Godot to teach those who followed the program how to make modular and expandable games.

Each branch of this repository is a different project that shows the state that we managed to get said project before the 2 hour meeting was over. Additionally they have been slightly re-written to make the code more understandable while also having detailed comments so that anyone can easily follow along or consult them in case they have forgotten how something works. In the case that anyone missed a meeting, they are able to catch up with the rest of the team by reading through the respective branch.<br>

Every script is writen in a way so that anyone can learn the basics of Godot by just installing the project and reading through the comments.<br>

All neccessary adjustments like and input map and other project settings have already been made.<br>

## Installation Instructions
Simply clone the branch of your choice and import the project to Godot by initializing the root folder.
